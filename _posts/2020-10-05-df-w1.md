## Why arrays

this course study the basics of **narrays(n-dimensional array) a.k.a tensors(math)**

* powerful data type
* many operations

By array operations, we could

* efficient

## Broadcast

广播原则

> if the axis length of **trailing dimension(the dimension from the end)** of two arrays are the same. or one of that is 1 then the broadcasting could be applied.

So there are only 2 cases where broadcasting suits:

1. two arrays with **different shapes but the axis length of trailing dimension matched**维数不相等的数组，但后缘维度轴长相符
2. two arrays with ones' length is 1其中一个数组长度为1

🍊 example

when the axis length of trailing dimension is the same, but the shapes are not

```python
arr1 = np.zeros((4,3)) #shape=(4,3)
arr2 = np.ones((3,)) #shape=(3, )
# exactly same as np.tile(arr2,(4,1)) vertically copying 4 times

# broadcast applied
arr_sum = arr1 + arr2
""" 
[[1. 1. 1.]
 [1. 1. 1.]
 [1. 1. 1.]
 [1. 1. 1.]] """
```

when the dimensions are the same but one axis of an array is 1

```python
arr1 = np.zeros((4,3)) #shape=(4,3)
arr2 = np.ones((4,1)) #shape=(4, 1)

# exactly same as np.tile(arr2,(1, 3)) , horizontally copy 3 times
# broadcast applied
arr_sum = arr1 + arr2
"""
 [[1. 1. 1.]
 [1. 1. 1.]
 [1. 1. 1.]
 [1. 1. 1.]] """
```
